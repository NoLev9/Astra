APPROACHES TO STUDYING
ANATOMY
Anatomy is the setting (structure) in which the events (func- tions) of
life occur. This book deals mainly with functional human gross
anatomyâ€”the examination of structures of the human that can be seen
without a microscope. The three main approaches to studying anatomy are
regional, systemic, and clinical (or applied), reflecting the bodyâ€TMs
organization and the priorities and purposes for studying it.
Regional Anatomy
Regional anatomy (topographical anatomy) considers the organization of the
human body as major parts or segments (Fig. I.1): a main body, consisting
of the head, neck, and trunk (subdivided into thorax, abdomen, back, and
pelvis/perineum), and paired upper limbs and lower limbs. All the major
parts may be further subdivided into areas and regions. Regional anatomy
is the method of studying the bodyâ€TMs structure by focusing attention on
a specific part (e.g., the head), area (the face), or region (the orbital
or eye region); examining the arrangement and relationships of the various
systemic structures (muscles, nerves, arteries, etc.) within it; and then
usually continuing to study adjacent regions in an ordered sequence.
Outside of this Introduction, the regional approach is followed in this
book, with each chapter addressing the anatomy of a major part of the
body. This is the approach usu- ally followed in anatomy courses that have
a laboratory com- ponent involving dissection. When studying anatomy by
this approach, it is important to routinely put the regional anatomy into
the context of that of adjacent regions, parts, and of the body as a
whole.
Regional anatomy also recognizes the bodyâ€TMs organization by layers:
skin, subcutaneous tissue, and deep fascia covering the deeper structures
of muscles, skeleton, and cavities, which contain viscera (internal
organs). Many of these deeper struc- tures are partially evident beneath
the bodyâ€TMs outer covering and may be studied and examined in living
individuals via surface anatomy.


Surface anatomy is an essential part of the study of regional anatomy. It
is specifically addressed in this book in â€œsurface anatomy sectionsâ€
(orange background) that provide knowledge of what lies under the skin and
what structures are perceptible to touch (palpable) in the living body at
rest and in action. We can learn much by observing the external form and
surface of the body and by observing or feeling the super- ficial aspects
of structures beneath its surface. The aim of this method is to visualize
(recall distinct mental images of) struc- tures that confer contour to the
surface or are palpable beneath it and, in clinical practice, to
distinguish any unusual or abnormal findings. In short, surface anatomy
requires a thorough understanding of the anatomy of the structures beneath
the surface. In people with stab wounds, for exam- ple, a physician must
be able to visualize the deep structures that may be injured. Knowledge of
surface anatomy can also decrease the need to memorize facts because the
body is always available to observe and palpate.
Physical examination is the clinical application of surface anatomy.
Palpation is a clinical technique, used with obser- vation and listening
for examining the body. Palpation of arterial pulses, for instance, is
part of a physical examination. Students of many of the health sciences

will learn to use instruments to facilitate examination of the body (such
as an ophthalmoscope for observation of features of the eyeballs) and to
listen to functioning parts of the body (a stethoscope to auscultate the
heart and lungs).
Regional study of deep structures and abnormalities in a living person is
now also possible by means of radiographic and sectional imaging and
endoscopy. Radiographic and sectional imaging (radiographic anatomy)
provides useful information about normal structures in living individuals,
demonstrating the effect of muscle tone, body fluids and pressures, and
gravity that cadaveric study does not. Diagnos- tic radiology reveals the
effects of trauma, pathology, and aging on normal structures.
